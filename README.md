# destinyscripts
various destiny scripts

For Bungies Destiny api, you will need an API key, you can create one here: https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Application
Once you have it, replace it in the script you are running 
(Ill try to remember to stick to using api_key as the variable name)

Ill dump more stuff here in the future.
